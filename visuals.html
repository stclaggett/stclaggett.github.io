			<p>This is a students response to a class assignment, “Make a Gif about the ‘Robot Freedom Movement”.</p>
			<p> I thought it was especially creative, as it was a Gif that took over the entire screen the moment you move the mouse. Many others in the class depicted a physical robot, however this student was thinking outside the box. The image you see that spans the whole screen blinks and changes colors and moves rapidly across the screen. When you refresh the page, it returns to normal size.</p>
