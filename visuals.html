			<h2>Interesting thing #1</h2>
			
			<img src="images/RFM.jpg">
			<p>This is a students response to a class assignment, &ldquo;Make a Gif about the &lsquo;Robot Freedom Movement&rdquo;.</p>
			<p> I thought it was especially creative, as it was a Gif that took over the entire screen the moment you moved the mouse. Many others in the class depicted a physical robot, however this student was thinking outside the box. Maybe the Robot Freedom Movement is Viral! The image you see that spans the whole browser window, blinks, changes colors, and moves rapidly across the screen. When you refresh the page, it returns to normal size.</p>

			<p>The Skimm is a really fresh, new way to get the news. It&rsquo;s quick, it&rsquo;s up-to-date, and it&rsquo;s easy to understand. Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s FUNNY! It was started by two young women after graduation. Subscribers are e-mailed daily updates about what’s going on in the world. They follow lots of big events. These two ladies stay up late the night before, and compose their Skimm. It’s short, and it gets to the point! Their skimms also link to other NYT articles, etc., in case you’d like to read more.</p>

			<h2>Interesting thing #3</h2>
			
			<img src="images/HONY.jpg">
			<p>This is a quote from the website: www.humansofnewyork.com</p>
			<p>&quot;My name is Brandon and I began Humans of New York in the summer of 2010. HONY resulted from an idea that I had to construct a photographic census of New York City. I thought it would be really cool to create an exhaustive catalogue of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants, so I set out to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers and plot their photos on a map. I worked for several months with this goal in mind. But somewhere along the way, HONY began to take on a much different character. I started collecting quotes and short stories from the people I met, and began including these snippets alongside the photographs. Taken together, these portraits and captions became the subject of a vibrant blog, which over the past two years has gained a large daily following. With nearly one million collective followers on Facebook and Tumblr, HONY now provides a worldwide audience with glimpses into the lives of strangers in New York City.&quot;</p>
